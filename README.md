# Sprint Review and Retrospective – CS 250

This repository contains the Sprint Review and Retrospective document created for the SNHU Travel project as part of the final assignment for CS 250: Software Development Lifecycle. The project applied Agile and Scrum practices throughout the course.

## Reflection

### How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program?  
How does creating “user stories” help with this?

Interpreting user needs starts with clear communication and breaking those needs into smaller, understandable parts. In this course, writing user stories helped bridge the gap between technical work and real-world expectations. By focusing on what the user wants to do and why, user stories made it easier to design features that mattered. They also gave the team a shared language to prioritize work, test outcomes, and stay aligned with the product’s goals.

### How do I approach developing programs?  
What Agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?

I now approach development as an iterative and collaborative process. Agile has shown me how valuable it is to work in sprints, maintain a product backlog, and stay adaptable when project needs shift. I plan to continue using sprint planning, Daily Scrum-style check-ins, retrospectives, and story point estimation. These processes not only keep projects moving forward but also make it easier to respond to changes without losing momentum.

### What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?

Being a good team member means contributing your skills while supporting others. It’s about communicating clearly, sharing responsibility for the outcome, and staying open to feedback. During this project, that meant helping the team stay focused during sprint meetings, raising blockers early, and taking ownership of specific tasks. Good team members help build trust by following through and staying engaged, even when priorities shift or challenges come up.
